# Animating-MRI-scans

This repo contains two Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate two methods for animating slices in MRI scans.

1. [scanning-the-head-classic.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/empet/Animating-MRI-scans/blob/master/scanning-the-head-classic.ipynb) presents
the method of animation available in Plotly version 1.12.10+.

2.[slices-MRI-scan.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/empet/Animating-MRI-scans/blob/master/slices-MRI-scan.ipynb) 
defines the animation transitions  with a new ContextManager, available starting with the  major release, Plotly 3.0.0.
